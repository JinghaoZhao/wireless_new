        ul
            li Homework will be due in class at the beginning of the lecture. See schedule for due dates of specific homework assignments.
            li Late homework assignments will not receive any credit.
            li There will be no partial credit for parts of the homework problems. E.g., if a homework assignment has 2 problems with 2 parts each, the score for that homework can be 0,1,2,3 or 4 out of 4. Only the sub-problems that are worked out completely and correctly will be credited.
            li Every homework assignment will have an equal weight and a scale of 10 points.

        h3 Course Policies
        ul
            li There will be no make-up exams
            li Reading assignments are assumed to be actual assignments, in other words, the instructor will assume that the students have studied the reading assignment material.
            li New assignments and deadlines will be announced in class. Hard copies of handouts, assignments etc. will usually not be distributed. Updates and copies of assignments will be available only from the web and/or e-mail. It is your responsibility to check whether anything new has been issued if you miss a class.
            li Objections to grading of assignments or exams must be filed in writing within one week after they have been returned to you.
            li No cheating allowed. Any form of cheating will result in an immediate failure of the course, and may be reported to school for further action.
            li If you have any questions regarding the homework, please see the teaching assistant first. You are welcome to ask me questions regarding the course, but regarding specific homework questions, please see me only after you have seen the TA first (and not found the answer satisfactory).
            li During the lecture please turn off any cellular phones, PDAs, laptops, etc.

        h3 Academic integrity
        p All the provisions of the code of academic integrity apply to this course. In addition, it is my understanding and expectation that your signature on any test or assignment means that you neither gave nor received unauthorized aid.
