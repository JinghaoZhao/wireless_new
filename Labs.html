        <p><strong>Introduction:</strong>&nbsp; In this section, we are going to develop a Tcl script for ns which simulates a simple topology.
          we are going to learn how to set up nodes and links, how to send data from one node to another, how to
          monitor a queue and how to start nam from simulation script to visualize simulation.

        <p><strong>Introduction:</strong>&nbsp; The experiment will make you get familiar with NS2 wireless simulation process. Through some
          simple scenarios, you will get intuition of different routing protocols,e.g. DSDV, AODV, DSR. These
          knowledge will be the fundamentals of your further research. You are expected to follow the instructions
          in the first part and do some of new test based on this.<br>

        <p><strong>Description of Ad Hoc routing Testbed:</strong>&nbsp; In this experiment you will use 3 laptops to configured to communicate in ad hoc mode. The laptops
          directly communicate with each other in peer-to-peer mode, without going through 802.11g access points.
          The topology of the ad hoc routing testbed is shown as the figure.
          In the above setup, you will use MAC address blocking feature of the iptables utility such that computer
          A cannot communicate directly with computer C and computer C cannot communicate directly with computer A.
          This is done to simulate a real-world ad hoc network scenario where computer A is out of the transmission
          range of computer C, but computer B can reach both computer A and computer C (thus it can act as
          intermediate hop to forward packets from computer A to computer C) within the confines of the lab.
          Though we can decrease the transmission power of WLAN card to really simulate a multi-hop scenario, we will
          leave it to further research.

      <p><strong>Introduction:</strong>&nbsp; Shown in the two figures, one wireless testbed is divided into two sections, wired and wireless. The wired
        network consists of two hubs, four computers and two access points. The PC router is named STREETCAR in
        testbed A or CABARET in testbed B. On either side of the router, there is one VLAN, totally 2 VLANs. The
        computer router acts as a connector as well as a gateway for the computers on either side of each VLAN. In
        each VLAN, one of the computers is playing the role of gateway or router to forward the packets between
        wired and wireless networks. WESTSIDE and DREAMCOAT in testbed A, SAIGON and RENT in testbed B are all
        connected to a wireless access point, which then acts as a connector to the wireless devices, iPAQs. The
        infrastructures of testbed A and B are illustrated in the two figures.
        &nbsp; Wired Equivalent Privacy(WEP) is an IEEE standard security protocol for wireless 802.11 networks.
        Introduced in 1997, WEP was found to be very inadequate and was superseded by WPA, WPA2 and 802.11i. Its
        authentication method was extremely weak and even helped an attacker decipher the secret encryption key.
        As a result, WEP authentication was dropped from the Wi-Fi specification.

        <p><strong>Introduction</strong>&nbsp;With MIMO, you can increase wireless system performance without increasing power consumption. When you use
          multiple antennas, the transmitted signal progresses through different wireless channels (from the
          transmitter antennas to the receiver antennas) and creates a capacity gain by exploiting channel diversity.<br>Refer to<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIMO">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIMO</a>&nbsp;for more information about MIMO.

      <p><strong>Introduction:</strong>&nbsp; In this project, we will take you onto the journey of learning and understanding ARTcode. ARTcode was one
        of our research projects. The goal of ARTcode is to create a code that serves as a barcode and can help
        users identify the contents of the barcode at the same time. The detailed information of ARTcode can be
        found at this address:&nbsp;<a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2971733">http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2971733.&nbsp;</a>You can click on “PDF” and obtain an explanation of ARTcode.<br>The prerequisite of this project includes K-means clustering and MATLAB programming. If you are not
        familiar with MATLAB, now is the time for you to grasp it.<br>Before we make any move, firstly we would like to give you a brief introduction on our ARTcode
        implementation MATLAB programs.<br>In ARTcode experiment folder, there are a number of MATLAB files, some data files, and a folder. The folder
        contains some testing images that you can work on. Of course you can put in your own images. Just don’t
        forget to adjust the image size (128*128)!<br>The MATLAB files in ARTcode experiment folder generate an ARTcode. The main function is encodeMain.m.
        Don’t panic, important information are provided in comments. Oh, another tip, you might want to read the
        questions first before you try to understand the MATLAB functions.
