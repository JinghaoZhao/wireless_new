      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>This course covers the basic concepts, principles and some applications of wireless communication system and mobile networks, including cellular networks, mobile IP, wireless LAN, satellite systems, ad hoc networks, sensor networks, wireless PAN, etc. The basic principles of wireless communication are provided at the beginning. And then, multiple different applications of wireless communication system and mobile networks are introduced. Moreover, the concepts of network capacity, network security and game theory are also presented. The main teaching target is to encourage students to demonstrate their understanding, insight and own thinking for the wireless communication system and to resolve the practical challenges independently. The course contains experiments and simulations based on ns2 and smartphones. In addition, projects and corresponding presentation are required.</p>

      <h3>Grading</h3>
      <p>Closed-book exam (20%) + Research project and presentation (50%) + Homework and experiments (30%)</p><strong>Homework grading</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Homework will be due in class at the beginning of the lecture. See schedule for due dates of specific homework assignments.</li>
        <li>Late homework assignments will not receive any credit.</li>
        <li>There will be no partial credit for parts of the homework problems. E.g., if a homework assignment has 2 problems with 2 parts each, the score for that homework can be 0,1,2,3 or 4 out of 4. Only the sub-problems that are worked out completely and correctly will be credited.</li>
        <li>Every homework assignment will have an equal weight and a scale of 10 points.</li>
      </ul><strong>Grades</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Every student earning 90% is guaranteed to have be in the A range (A-, A, A+).</li>
        <li>Every student earning 80% is guaranteed to have be in the B range (B-. B, B+).</li>
        <li>Every student earning 70% is guaranteed to have be in the C range (C-,C,C+).</li>
        <li>Every student earning 60% is guaranteed to have be in the D range (D-, D, D+).</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>   Audit students must earn a B average on the homework.</blockquote>
